You can declare it as a fraction `app:focusPoint="30%"` and if is not declared the top of the view is used.                                                                                       |
| `zoomFocusPointEnabled`           |      true      | If you set this to ``false`` the zoomFocusPoint won't take effect any more while zooming. The zoom will always be focused at the center of your gesture.                                                                                                                                                                          |
